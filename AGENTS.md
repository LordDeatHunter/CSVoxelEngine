## Project overview

A Minecraft-style voxel engine written in C# on .NET 9, using **Silk.NET** (windowing, input, OpenGL bindings) and StbImageSharp for texture loading. It renders an infinite, procedurally generated world (FastNoiseLite OpenSimplex2 noise) with chunk streaming, an underground of 3D-noise caves, worm-carved tunnels and heightmap ravines, greedy per-face meshing with ambient occlusion, frustum culling, block breaking/placement via raycast, and simple player physics (gravity, jumping, collision). The player spawns standing on the terrain at the origin (`Camera.SpawnPosition`).

There is a single executable project. Historical naming quirks to be aware of:

- The solution is `OpenGLTest.sln`, the project folder is `OpenGLTest/`, the csproj is `OpenGLTest/silkgltriangle.csproj`, and **all code lives in the `silkgltriangle` namespace**. Keep new files in that namespace unless deliberately renaming everything.
- There are no test projects and no CI. Verification is done by building and running the game.

## Build and run

```powershell
dotnet build OpenGLTest.sln
dotnet run --project OpenGLTest/silkgltriangle.csproj
```

Setting the `VOXEL_SPAWN` environment variable to `x,y,z` (three comma-separated floats, e.g. `-40,-107,-75`) starts the camera eye at exactly that world position instead of on the surface at the origin, which is handy for inspecting a specific cave or feature without flying to it; an unparseable value is ignored with a console warning.

The app opens a window and grabs the mouse. Controls: WASD to move, mouse to look, Space to jump, double-tap Space to toggle flight (Space/Left Ctrl for up/down while flying), `C` to toggle noclip, Left Shift for 10x speed, hold left-click to mine a block (hit-based: one hit per `World.BlockHitSeconds` = 200 ms removes 1 HP of the block's `hardness`, declared in its JSON - 5 for most blocks, so ~1s, 8 for logs, 2 for leaves, and `0` means it pops on first contact like a pebble; damage resets if you release or switch target; instant while noclip; stepped progress overlay via `break-*.glsl`; each hit pops the block out and back via `RenderManager.RenderBlockPop`), right-click to place stone, `X` to toggle debug logging (FPS/position to console), Escape to quit.

Shaders (`assets/shaders/**/*.glsl`), textures (`assets/textures/**/*.png`), fonts (`assets/fonts/**/*.ttf`) and all content JSON (`assets/**/*.json` — blocks, items, loot tables, models) are copied to the output directory via `CopyToOutputDirectory` rules in the csproj — **new asset types/extensions need a matching `<None Update>` entry** or they won't be found at runtime. The JSON rule is a wildcard over the whole `assets` tree, so adding a block, item, loot table or model needs no csproj edit.

Assets are opened by **relative** path (`FileUtils.ReadFile("assets/shaders/...")`, `TextureLoader.LoadFromFile(gl, "assets/textures/atlas.png")` in `RenderManager.LoadResources`), so the app must be launched with a working directory that contains `assets/` — either the build output directory or `OpenGLTest/`. `dotnet run --project OpenGLTest/silkgltriangle.csproj` satisfies this (it runs from the project folder); launching the built executable from an arbitrary directory does not.

## Content: blocks, items, models and loot are data

Nothing about a block is hardcoded any more. `ContentRegistry` reads `assets/data` and
`assets/models` at startup, hands out byte ids and publishes read-only tables that the rest of
the engine indexes by id. **Adding a block means adding JSON, not editing C#.**

Ids are `byte` and chunk storage is a `byte[]`: id 0 is air (it has no definition file, and a
block may not be named `air`), then blocks sorted by file name, then items sorted by file name.
Blocks and items therefore share 255 ids and the registry throws if they overflow. Code that has
to name a specific block does it through a well-known handle (`BlockType.Stone`,
`ItemType.Flint`) resolved by name in `ContentRegistry.ResolveHandles`, so a renamed or deleted
JSON file fails loudly at startup instead of silently mis-indexing. Every content error names the
file it came from.

### Startup order (`RenderManager.LoadResources`)

1. `ContentRegistry.Load("assets")` - parses items, loot tables, blocks and every model they
   reference, assigns ids and resolves handles. No GL, no atlas.
2. `TextureAtlas.Build(gl, "assets/textures/blocks")` - stitches the tiles.
3. `ContentRegistry.BakeModels()` - bakes each block's model into atlas-ready quads and settles
   the defaults that need to know whether the result is a full cube (`occludes`, `light.passes`).
4. Shaders, `BlockCubeCache`, `ItemMeshCache`, `UIRenderer`, then the `World`.

The `World` (and with it every worker thread) is created last, so all content tables are
immutable by the time anything but the main thread can see them. Keep it that way.

### Block schema (`assets/data/blocks/<name>.json`)

Every field is optional except `model`. Parsing is case-insensitive and tolerates comments and
trailing commas.

| field | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | required | a `"block/cube_all"`-style path under `assets/models/`, **or** an inline model object with the same schema |
| `hardness` | 5 | hits to break, one per `World.BlockHitSeconds`; `0` means it breaks on first contact (pebble) |
| `solid` | true | collides with bodies (`BlockType.IsSolid`) |
| `occludes` | full cube && !cutout | hides a neighbouring full cube's face (`OccludesNeighbours`) |
| `cullSelf` | false | also cull faces against a neighbour of the same block (glass) |
| `castsAO` | `solid` | darkens neighbouring faces (`CastsAmbientOcclusion`) |
| `cutout` | false | alpha-tested texture; forces `occludes` off whatever the file says |
| `sway` | false | leaf-wind sway in the vertex shader |
| `light.emission` | 0 | 0..15 (`LightEmission`) |
| `light.passes` | `!fullCube` | whether voxel light travels through the cell (`PassesLight`) |
| `renderer` | `"model"` | `model` (baked quads), `tapered_wood` or `pebbles` (procedural emitters) |
| `wood.taperLevel` | none | 0 = full-cube log, 1..5 taper steps; across all blocks 0..5 must be covered exactly once |
| `wood.halfWidth` | 0.5 | half edge length of the tapered box, in blocks (`HalfWidth`) |
| `hasItem` | true | gets an inventory slot and can be held; false for taper wood and pebbles |
| `needsSupport` | false | pops, rolling its loot, when the block below is removed |
| `onBreak` | `"drop"` | `drop` (roll loot) or `prime_tnt` (no drop, spawns a `PrimedTnt`) |
| `loot` | the table sharing this block's name, else drop self | loot table name; `"none"` drops nothing |

Two traps worth repeating: a **model that is not a full cube needs `light.passes: true`** (which
is its default) or its own cell stays dark and the interior quads render black; and a **cutout
block must not occlude**, which the registry enforces rather than trusting the file.

### Item schema (`assets/data/items/<name>.json`)

```json
{ "name": "Flint", "texture": "assets/textures/items/flint.png" }
```

### Loot schema (`assets/data/loot/<name>.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "pools": [
    {
      "rolls": 1,                    // int, {"min":1,"max":3}, or {"provider":"pebble_count"}
      "chance": 0.15,                // the whole pool is skipped otherwise; default 1
      "entries": [
        { "item": "cobblestone", "weight": 1, "count": 1 },  // count: int or {min,max}; weight default 1
        { "empty": true, "weight": 3 }                       // weighted nothing
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An `item` name resolves against blocks first, then items; a `block/` or `item/` prefix pins it to
one of the two. `leaves.json` therefore has to say `"item/branch"`, because a *block* named
`branch` (the thickest taper step) exists as well. The only roll-count provider is `pebble_count`
(`PebbleGenerator.CountAt(x, z)` at the loot context's cell).

Every destruction path rolls through one place: `DropManager.RollLoot` (a block with no table
drops itself, `LootTable.None` drops nothing) and its spawning wrapper `SpawnLoot`. Mining
(`World.RemoveBlock`), blasts (`TntManager.Detonate`) and felled trees (`TopplingTree.TakeDrops`)
all go through it, so a block's yield never depends on how it came down.

### Model schema (`assets/models/block/<name>.json`)

Minecraft Java block-model format, i.e. what BlockBench exports: `parent` (chained, cycles
rejected), `textures` (`#var` refs, child entries overriding the parent's) and `elements[]` with
`from`/`to` in 0..16, optional `rotation {origin, axis, angle, rescale}`, `shade`, and `faces`
carrying `uv`, `texture`, `cullface` and `rotation`. `tintindex`, `display`, `ambientocclusion`
and `gui_light` are ignored. Texture refs are normalized by stripping `minecraft:` and any
leading `block/` or `blocks/`, then looked up as an atlas tile.

Minecraft's face names map onto the engine's face indices (`Chunk.CubeFaces`) as
`north` = -Z = 0, `south` = +Z = 1, `west` = -X = 2, `east` = +X = 3, `up` = +Y = 4,
`down` = -Y = 5.

Four built-in parents mirror Minecraft's byte for byte, so a BlockBench export referencing them
works unchanged: `cube` (six faces, `#north #south #east #west #up #down`), `cube_all` (all six
`#all`), `cube_column` (`#end` on up/down, `#side` around) and `cube_bottom_top` (`#top`,
`#bottom`, `#side`). `ContentRegistry.BakeModels` self-checks at startup that all four still bake
to six full faces.

## Architecture: threading model (the most important thing to preserve)

Chunk work is split across threads, and OpenGL calls are only legal on the main thread:

1. `ChunkGenerationWorker` runs dedicated background threads that scan positions around the camera (closest first) and call `ChunkManager.QueueChunk`, which creates the `Chunk` and generates its block data **on that background thread**.
2. Meshing is scheduled by `ChunkManager.ProcessDirtyChunks` (main thread, per-frame budget `MaxDirtyChunksPerFrame`) and runs on the thread pool via `Task.Run`, throttled by a `SemaphoreSlim` (`MaxConcurrentMeshGenerations`). Mesh generation produces CPU-side `ChunkMeshData` only.
3. Completed mesh data lands in `_completedMeshQueue` and is uploaded to the GPU on the **main thread** in `ApplyCompletedMeshes`, sorted closest-first and capped at `MaxMeshUploadsPerFrame` per frame.

Rules that follow from this:

- **Never call GL functions (buffer uploads, `Mesh` creation/disposal, shader use) off the main thread.** Background work must only produce plain data handed over via the concurrent queues.
- A chunk is only meshed when its block data is ready **and all 6 cardinal neighbors exist with ready data** (`HasAllNeighbors`) — meshing reads neighbor blocks for face culling and cross-chunk AO. Breaking this reintroduces holes/seams at chunk borders (see git history).
- Shared state uses `ConcurrentDictionary`/`ConcurrentQueue`; `Chunk.IsBlockDataReady` is `volatile`. Keep new shared state lock-free in the same style.
- Editing a block on a chunk border must also remesh the affected neighbor chunk(s) — block edits use `ChunkManager.ImmediateRemesh` / `MarkDirty`.
- Performance tuning knobs all live in `WorldGenerationConfig`; change constants there rather than hardcoding budgets elsewhere.
- Animation curves (interpolation, easing, one-shot pulses) belong in `MathUtils`, not inline in gameplay or render code — everything time-driven should be lerped through one of those helpers rather than snapped.

Other invariants:

- World/chunk coordinates: `Chunk.Position` is in chunk units; world pos = chunk pos × `Chunk.Size` (16). Chunks are cubic and stacked vertically too (3D chunk grid, not 2D columns).
- Blocks are `byte` IDs; `0` is air. Everything else about a block comes from `assets/data/blocks/<name>.json` through `ContentRegistry` (see "Content" above), never from a new `switch` on the id. Hot paths read the flat mirrors (`BlockType.IsSolid/Occludes/CastsAO`, `BlockType.Emission`, `BlockType.PassesLightById`) rather than `BlockType.ById[...]`, so keep new per-id flags in that shape.
- Worldgen must stay deterministic and thread-safe (`FastNoiseLite.GetNoise` is read-only after setup; noise instances are configured once in static constructors and never re-tuned per call). All noise seeds derive from `WorldGenerationConfig.Seed` plus fixed per-channel offsets (`TerrainGenerator.MakeNoise`). Before player edits, terrain obeys:
  - **Nothing generated is ever solid above `height(x,z)`** — heights come from `Chunk.GetColumnData(...).Heights` (or the `GetColumnHeights` wrapper) and already include ravines, which are cut into the heightmap so the far LOD sees them too. The block at `height` is solid unless a cave or entrance carved it.
  - Both carvers only ever **remove** blocks: `Chunk.GenerateBlockData` fills the columns (grass at depth 0, dirt down to `DirtDepth`, stone below), then `NoiseCaves.Carve` and `WormCarver.Carve` clear air out of the result and `_solidCount` is recounted.
  - Caves fade out within ~`CaveSurfaceFadeEnd` blocks of the surface (`WormSurfaceMargin` for worms), except inside entrance zones — sparse patches where `ColumnData.EntranceWeight` lifts the fade and caves reach the sky.
  - Worldgen is a **pure function of world position**: each chunk generates its own blocks with no cross-chunk writes, so neighbours agree at their borders without shared state. Worm paths are cached per 64-block XZ cell in `WormCarver` exactly the way column data is cached per chunk column in `Chunk.GetColumnData` (compute-then-overwrite, wholesale `Clear` at the size limit — entries are deterministic, so a race yields identical values).
  - 3D cave noise is sampled on a `CaveNoiseStride` lattice (aligned to world coordinates so adjacent chunks share boundary samples) and trilinearly interpolated per block before thresholding.
- **Far-terrain LOD**: full-detail chunks load to `ChunkRadius` (16 chunks = 256 blocks); a cascade of LOD rings defined in `LodRegion.Levels` extends the render distance (level 1: 2-block cells to 512, level 2: 4-block cells to 1024, level 3: 8-block cells to 2048 blocks). Regions are columns meshed at reduced resolution straight from the heightmap cache (no block data). Each level's heights are eroded (min over a widened fine-column window) and biased downward so its mesh sits strictly inside real terrain *and* strictly below the next finer level — finer geometry always buries coarser via the depth buffer, so no masking or camera-driven remeshing exists. Because those shells are stacked, only one level may actually be drawn per area — otherwise they are all visible once the camera is inside the terrain — so `LodManager.UpdateBuriedFlags` marks each region whose footprint is fully covered by *loaded* finer-level regions (region grids nest exactly: one region = ratio×ratio regions of the finer level) and `RenderLod` skips those. Testing loaded regions rather than each level's radius means an unbuilt finer region can never open a hole in the horizon. The finest level (0) has no finer level to hide it, so it is additionally marked buried wherever the full-detail chunks its shell could show through are loaded *and* meshed (`LodManager.IsCoveredByChunks`, using the per-column inclusive chunk-Y ranges recorded at region build in `LodRegion.ColumnCyMin/ColumnCyMax` and `Chunk.IsMeshed`, which unlike `HasMesh` is true for all-air and fully enclosed chunks too). This is needed because caves cut into the band the shell occupies and would otherwise show it from inside; presence is tested per chunk rather than by horizontal distance because the load volume is a sphere. LOD side faces use grass at the top cell, dirt above `NominalDirtDepth` and the stone tile below it, so far cliffs match near ones. The nesting invariants (`SampleMargin(L+1) >= SampleMargin(L) + CellSize(L) - 1`, `HeightBias(L+1) >= HeightBias(L) + CellSize(L)`) must hold when adding levels, and `Camera.NearPlane`/`FarPlane` are tuned to keep those separations from z-fighting at the outermost ring. LOD draws before chunks, coarsest level first (`RenderManager.RenderLod`). Destroying a block would expose the buried LOD, so removals cap that column's LOD height below the removed block (`LodRegion.LowerColumnBelow`) and affected regions on every level rebuild (`LodManager.MarkEditedColumn`); placements need nothing.

## Conventions

- C# with file-scoped namespaces, one type per file, `_camelCase` private fields, PascalCase public members. Primary constructors are used where natural (`ChunkManager(GL gl)`).
- XML doc comments (`/// <summary>`) on classes and non-obvious public methods; brief `//` comments explaining *why* for tricky logic. Match the existing density — the code is moderately commented.
- **New blocks go in JSON, not C#.** When a block has to behave differently, prefer a new data flag on `BlockDefinition`/`BlockType` that every call site reads over another per-id branch in gameplay code — the point of the content registry is that `World`, `TntManager` and the mesher ask "what does this block do?" instead of "which block is this?".
- `FastNoiseLite.cs` is vendored third-party code — do not reformat or refactor it.
- No test framework exists. Verify changes by running the game and using the `X` debug overlay (FPS, position, grounded state). Watch the console for chunk generation errors — worker threads catch and log exceptions rather than crashing.
- Branch naming follows feature work off `master` (current work is on `worldgen`). Commit messages are short imperative sentences ("Add block placement", "Fix performance").
