# Performance TODO

Everything here is **done** — this file stays as the measurement protocol, the
last profile snapshot, and the do-not-retry list. Per-item history lives in git
(`git log --oneline -- PERF_TODO.md FLUID_PERF.md`).

Machine for every number below: Release, Quadro T1000 (GL 4.6, driver 597.06),
12 CPUs, `SustainedLowLatency`, `VOXEL_TIME=60`, `VOXEL_DEBUG=1`.

## How to measure

Repeatable fly (checked in): `OpenGLTest/visual-examples/perf-fly.json` — 10 s
settle at spawn, teleport + sprint-walk legs over land, water bay (228,-138) and
a far teleport (-120,100). Shots land in `OpenGLTest/visual/perf-fly/` (gitignored).
Run from `OpenGLTest/` so `assets/` resolves:

```powershell
$env:VOXEL_DEBUG="1"; $env:VOXEL_TIME="60"; $env:VOXEL_SCRIPT="visual-examples/perf-fly.json"
dotnet run --project silkgltriangle.csproj -c Release --no-build
```

Two profiler traps, read before trusting a number:

- In scripted runs `progUpdate` is just the log/close shell (~0.01 ms): `Drive`'s
  world calls time themselves since item 22, so the CPU sections sum to the frame
  instead of doubling it. (Pre-22 logs show `progUpdate` 5-25 ms containing all of
  `World.Update` — do not compare across that boundary.) In real play `progUpdate`
  is the input shell (~0.2-0.5 ms).
- The `perf` console line shows `avg~max` per section (`~` = worst single frame in
  the 1 s window) with a `/gpuAvg~gpuMax` suffix on render passes (item 18) — read
  the `~` half for spikes, the avg half for steady cost. `lighting` CPU absorbs the
  GPU stall (it is the frame's first GL call), so a fat `lighting` row with a
  matching GPU sum means GPU-bound, not lighting-bound. The `X` overlay keeps CPU
  avg+max and GPU avg only (fixed-width rows); the console line is the spike record.

## Current profile (2026-09-11 fly, 58 `perf` lines)

| Phase | Frame | FPS | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settled, land | 8.8-10.5 ms | 95-114 | cpu ~9-10, gpu ~9-10; balanced |
| Settled, over water | 9.4-11.4 ms | 88-106 | `reflect` GPU 0 when no water on screen, up to ~8 ms when the bay is in view; `worldPass` GPU 3.5-5.6 ms is the largest steady cost |
| Streaming (first 10 s) | 18-39 ms | 25-54 | worst 1 s window 32.9 ms avg (true single-frame max higher, not logged) |
| Teleport | one ~30 ms window | ~34 | unload storm 17077 -> 4991 chunks, `lod` 2-3 ms |
| Underwater | ~10-14 ms | 72-100 | `raysPass` GPU 1.5-2.3 ms while submerged |
| Screenshot step | +7-18 ms | 1 fps that frame | PNG encode on the render thread (scripted runs only) |

Streaming-second breakdown (avg over the 1 s window, so peaks are higher):
`lod` up to 10.7, `chunkDirty` up to 6.3, `chunkApply` up to 5.8, `fluidTick`
up to 4.6, `fluidWake` up to 0.96, `lighting` CPU 3-7 (stall absorber, see traps).
Settled: `chunkApply`/`chunkDirty`/`lod`/`fluidTick` all <= 0.2 ms.

GC: streaming 17-25 gen0/s, 8-11 gen1/s, 0-2 gen2/s; settled 1-3 gen0/s, ~0 gen1.
Pool growth during first stream-in only: opaque 65536 -> 131072 -> 262144 units
(**512 MB**), translucent to 65536 (128 MB). No growth after settle.
`fluidTick` avg is 0-0.6 ms settled, with worst frames in the tens of ms at
stream-in (visible in the `~max` half since the console line grew max columns).

### Hitch ranking (what actually drops frames)

1. **Chunk streaming burst** — gen + mesh schedule + upload + LOD rebuild.
   100+ fps settled -> 25-55 fps streaming. `lod`/`chunkDirty`/`chunkApply` rows.
2. **Reflection + world pass when water is on screen** — `reflect` GPU 0 -> 8 ms,
   `worldPass` GPU up to 5.6 ms. Looking at the bay costs ~2x dry land.
3. **Geometry pool doubling mid-stream** (opaque to 512 MB) — one-time copy hitch.
4. **Underwater `raysPass`** (1.5-2.3 ms GPU) and **`cloudPass`** (0.7-1.5 ms when
   clouds in view). Clouds were already cut 63 % (item 15); remainder is steady, not spiky.
5. **Fluid wake storm** at spawn over the sea — now bounded (queue 100-196k -> 8-12k),
   secondary to item 1.
6. **Screenshot encode** 7-18 ms — scripted runs only, but fix anyway (item 20).
7. **`uiPass`** 0.5-1 ms settled — the `X` overlay itself; subtract before comparing.

## Ruled out (do not retry without new evidence)

- Early-Z cutout/solid split: regressed spawn 1.72 -> 1.87 ms and forest
  1.83 -> 2.13 ms GPU on RTX 3070. Driver keeps the early depth *test*; only the
  write defers. Change stashed, not in tree.
- Reflection geometry cutoff (drop LOD / cap mirrored chunks at 192 blocks):
  leaves a hard terrain/sky seam that the animated wave-normal offset turns into
  flicker. A planar mirror needs continuous far terrain.
- Half-rate shadow map: reflection samples the map every frame, so a 2-frame
  cadence steps mirrored shading at fps/2. Pair only with a flicker-free design.
- Compute frustum cull (Phase 5): post-MDI cull+sort+fill is ~2 % of the T1000
  frame (`worldPass` 0.50, `shadows` 0.26, `waterPass` 0.09, `reflect` 0.83 ms).
  Retry only if a CPU-bound profile shows cull+sort above ~1 ms.
- Fluid chunk-cache (16-slot direct-mapped): no spike reduction alone, 16 vs 256
  slots identical — per-cell cost was the whole-set sort, not dictionary lookups.
  The sort is gone (per-frame spread); no per-tick cap either (a per-tick cap
  freezes fluid because wakes schedule 60/s while ticks run 4/s).
- Mud 6-face gate as specified: not outcome-equivalent (diagonal dirt can be wet
  with no face-adjacent dirt). Only valid under an unproven scheduling invariant.
- VSync/limiters, GL debug context, per-frame `GetError`, worker priorities,
  shader ALU (4-tap PCF, 8 point lights), uniform location lookups, indexed mesh
  upload — all audited, not the problem.
